# Basys_3_Snake_Game
This collection of files is a vivado project that operates a snake game using a VGA connection to a monitor.

A majority of the files included are the vivado generated files when making a new project. The written code can be found in the Snake_Game.src folder.
The source files were originally used during a 2 week long class project which required students to create a start file for a snake game. The original produced a snake that would appear and move left. The snake was required to eat an apple which would then produce a psuedo-random location for a new apple. The snake was also required to show collision with the boundaries.

We were given an extra credit opportunity to flesh out the rest of the game and complete an operational snake game with the files we already produced. This was a welcome challenge and a great motivator to complete the project. The visuals are nothing pretty, but the game runs well.
